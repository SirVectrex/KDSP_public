# Metro-Bike - KDSP Proj
Submitted at @OTH

## Running this project

This submission is built on streamlit, a simple frontend framework for python, that creates a host-able front-end application.

To install all dependencies for this project:
```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run this application:
```shell
    streamlit run Home.py
```
This command will run the app on localhost. Preferably (if available) on port 8051.

## Main Challange

1. Find K-nearest bikestations around a given location based on bikes available.
2. Find K-nearest bikestations around a given location, that has bike-racks available
3. Given a location and destination, show the total route on a map (only biking and walking)
